ReplyMate is an automated, AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance your digital communication. By leveraging computer vision and advanced language models, this application reads your on-screen chat conversations and provides real-time, contextually relevant replies.

The system's core functionality is built on a robust, multi-component architecture:

Computer Vision and OCR: Using screen region scanning, ReplyMate acts as the "eyes" of the system, employing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert on-screen text from applications like WhatsApp, Instagram, or Telegram into a format that the AI can process.

Prompt-based AI Integration: The heart of the application is its integration with the Google Gemini API. This allows the system to generate intelligent, human-like replies based on the conversation context.

User Personalization: To ensure the generated replies match your unique tone and style, the system uses a personalized JSON file. This file acts as a style guide, providing the AI with instructions on your communication habits, including your preferred tone, use of Hinglish, and emojis.

User Control: Replies are not sent automatically. The system suggests a reply that is triggered by specific hotkeys, giving you full control over when to use the bot's suggestions.

ReplyMate is an excellent example of a real-world application of AI, combining screen automation with natural language processing to create a smart, efficient, and personalized communication tool.
